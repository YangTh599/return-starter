## Python: Understanding Return Statements

### Background Information

- Watch this brief video about [return statements](https://youtu.be/ZnBQfF5JFDM?feature=shared) in Python

### Coding

Objective: To learn how to define and use a `return` statement with a Python function.

- Complete the practice projects outlined below
- Start with the first project, which is easier, and end with the last project, which is more challenging
- Use comments to label each project in your script

#### Destination Europe

- Write a function `describe_vacation()` that takes three parameters:
  - destination
  - activity
  - season
- Assign the `season` parameter a default value of *summer*
- **First function call**: Return to a variable named `description1` an f-string that includes:
  - your destination
  - the season
  - your activity (what you will do while on vacation)
  - Example: I am going to **Rome** for a **summer** vacation.  I will **explore ancient ruins** there.
  - Use only two arguments -- one for your destination, the other for your activity
- **Second function call**: Return to a variable named `description2` an f-string that includes the same placeholders you used in your first function call
  - Use THREE arguments -- one for your destination, another for your activity, a third for the season (spring or fall, for example)
  - Example: I am going to **Paris** for a **fall** vacation.  I will **enjoy sampling French pastries** there.
